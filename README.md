# Object_Oriented_Programming

## Purpose

This project contains the syntax for beginner to do the object oriented programming.

## Folder

### 1.OOP_syntax_shirt_practice
This folder includes the code to create an OOP class called Shirt
The Shirt class contains the characteristic: color, size, style, price, and contains two method: change_price() and discount()
### 2.OOP_syntax_pants_practice
This folder includes the code to create an OOP class called Pants and SalesPerson
The Pants class attributes should include color, waist_size, length, price
The class should have two methods: change_price() a method to change the price attribute, discount() to calculate a discount

The a SalesPerson class with the following characteristics: first_name, last_name, employee_id, salary, pants_sold, total_sales
The class should have four methods: sell_pants() a method to change the price attribute, calculate_sales() a method to calculate the sales, display_sales() a method to print out all the pants sold with nice formatting, and calculate_commission() a method to calculate the salesperson commission based on total sales and a percentage
### 3.OOP_code_gaussian_class
This folder includes the code to create an OOP class called Gaussian
The Gaussian class has three attributes: the mean, standard deviation, data 
The class should have below methods: calculate_mean, calculate_stdev, read_data_file, plot_histogram, pdf, plot_histogram_pdf
### 4.OOP_code_magic_methods
Beyond the Gaussian in folder 3.OOP_code_gaussian_class, this folder contains more magic methods: __add__(): Magic method to add together two Gaussian distributions, and __repr__(): Magic method to output the characteristics of the Gaussian instance
### 5.OOP_code_inheritance_clothing
Example of inheritance, using the Clothing class as parent class
The code contains a Clothing parent class and three children classes: Shirt, Pants, and Blouse
### 6.OOP_code_inheritance_probability_distributions
To give another example of inheritance, the Gaussian distribution code is refactored into a generic Distribution class and a Gaussian distribution class.
